## About
I am a Master's student in Data Science at Stanford University within the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME)](https://icme.stanford.edu/), and a research assistant in [Prof. Nigam Shah's group](http://shahlab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR). Before joining Stanford, I obtained a Diplôme d'Ingénieur (MS) in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique in France.

I'm passionate about new technologies and always eager to learn. I love building things using my computing skills, and am thrilled to combine that with my strong maths background. That's why I found the perfect fit in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, looking for exciting and challenging projects.
