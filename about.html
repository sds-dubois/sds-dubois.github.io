## About

I am a technology enthusiast with an entrepreneurial mindset. I have co-founded [Eliot](https://www.eliotandme.com), a data-driven start-up that helps people evaluate short-term rental opportunities, and was acquired by Airbnb. 
Prior to that, I have conducted research in machine learning at Stanford and MIT, and received a masterâ€™s degree from Ecole Polytechnique and Stanford ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)).
