## About
I'm a Master's student in Data Science at Stanford University, within the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/). Before that I was at Ecole Polytechnique in France where I received my Diplôme d'Ingénieur (MS) in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

I'm passionate about new technologies and always eager to learn. I love building things using my computing skills, and am thrilled to combine that with my strong maths background. That's why I found the perfect fit in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, looking for exciting and challenging projects.
