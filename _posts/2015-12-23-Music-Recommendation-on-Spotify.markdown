title: Music Recommendation on Spotify
post-preview: I am using [Echo Nest and Spotify APIs](http://static.echonest.com/enspex/) to build my own recommender system directly on Spotify. Thanks to Echo Nest, I get all the information I need on the music I can listen (eg. which artists are similar to the artists I like), while Spotify is a really nice player. Even though there is still a lot to do, I've now a usable **[Music Manager](https://github.com/sds-dubois/MusicManager)** that can automatically find music I'm likely to appreciate, add it to one of my Spotify playlists, and keep track of my tastes when I listen to its suggestions.

**[MusicManager](https://github.com/sds-dubois/MusicManager)** is an other personal project on which I'm currently working. I am using [Echo Nest and Spotify APIs](http://static.echonest.com/enspex/) to build my own recommender system directly on Spotify. Thanks to Echo Nest, I get all the information I need on the music I can listen (eg. which artists are similar to the artists I like), while Spotify is a really nice player. Even though there is still a lot to do, I've now a usable Music Manager that can automatically find music I'm likely to appreciate, add it to one of my Spotify playlists, and keep track of my tastes when I listen to its suggestions.  

Most of the recommender systems look for similarities in users so that they can guess a given user's opinion for a given object (here, it would be a song I haven't listened to). Unfortunately I don't have access on all this data, and even though Spotify could give me some similar information, it's not provided by the API. So I decided to try another approach that works in two steps. First, I'm more focusing on the artists. Precisely I am building a graph of artists, starting with those I know I like, and adding similar artists. This is possible thanks to the Echo Nest API. Actually, I am also adding similar artists of the artists that are similar to those I like, and even similar artists of the latter, etc... From this graph, I compute some *score* for each artist, based on its *depth* (0: an artist I like, *d+1*: an artist similar to an artist of depth *d*), its *popularity*, and its *degree* in the artist graph. And I can finally keep only the *best* artists with regards to this metric. Below is an example of the subgraph with the best artists.

From the selected artists, I look for their *hotness* (as defined by Echo Nest) song that I haven't listened to yet, and add them to one of my Spotify playlist. I can then go on Spotify and listen to these recommendations. And while I'm listening, I can easily give feedback to the Music Manager so that it will record my tastes and make better suggestions in the future. For example, I can remove a song I don't like by running `$python player.py pass track_id` in the console, where *track_id* is the Spotify ID of the song (obtained in one click in the player).  

During all these steps, I am keeping track of all the songs suggested and the feedback I gave when listening to them. I am also downloading the songs' characteristics via the Echo Nest API. So I get a database that looks like this :

The *opinion* field is the feedback I gave and can be either 0 (disliked), 1 (liked), or -1 (don't know yet). I am planning to mine this database to refine the suggestions the Music Manager could do later, so there is more to come !  

In the meanwhile, you can already use it as it is. You'll find the code and instructions in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/sds-dubois/MusicManager). And please reach out if you want to participate to the project or if you want to provide any feedback !
